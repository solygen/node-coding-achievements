# Coding Achievements

> conceptualizing phase

**please feel free joining me to develop this concept**

## IDEA

- node cli that analyses your commits
- define achievements that can be mached against a commit message or commit diff
- write these achievement to a dot file
- display your current state nicely in terminal
- scope: javascript(, css, git)

## Problems

- small changes on someone else's code (like tabs to space)


## Possible Achievements


**Based on commit diff**

- commited your first 'debugger' statement
- commited ten 'debugger' statements
- commited hundred 'debugger' statements
- 100 commits
- 500 commits
- 1000 commits
- 5000 commits
- 10000 commits
- writing your first lambda function
- use all es6 features (progress, maybe subachievements)
- use all availabe css selectors (progress, maybe subachievements)
- use all recommended ways to improve a11y (progress, maybe subachievements)

**Based on commit message**

- write your first test (checks for 'test'?)
- fix your first bug (checks for 'fixes, fixed'?)
- realise your first user story (checks for 'story'?)
